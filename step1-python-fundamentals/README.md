# Step 1: Python Fundamentals

Welcome to Step 1 of the **Generative AI Course**!  
In this step, we focus on mastering **Python basics** which are essential before diving into data science, machine learning, and generative AI.

This folder contains:

- `basics.py` → Core Python syntax, variables, loops, functions, data structures, file I/O, and exception handling
- `exercises.py` → Hands-on practice exercises to reinforce learning

## Topics Covered

### 1. Variables and Data Types
- Integers, floats, strings, booleans
- Dynamic typing in Python
- Examples of assignment and printing values

### 2. Basic Operators
- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
- Understanding integer division and modulo

### 3. Conditional Statements
- `if`, `elif`, `else` for decision-making
- Example: Checking age categories

### 4. Loops
- `for` loops with `range()` and lists
- `while` loops with conditions
- Practice iterating and counting

### 5. Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Arguments and return values
- Default arguments
- Example: `greet()` and `power()` functions

### 6. Lists
- Creating lists, accessing elements, appending/removing
- Iterating through lists
- Example: Fruits list manipulation

### 7. Dictionaries
- Key-value storage
- Adding, accessing, removing items
- Iterating through dictionary items
- Example: Person dictionary

### 8. Tuples
- Immutable lists
- Example: `(x, y)` coordinates

### 9. Sets
- Unique elements, no duplicates
- Adding and removing items
- Example: Colors set

### 10. File I/O
- Writing to files
- Reading from files
- Using `with open()` context manager
- Example: `example.txt`

### 11. Exception Handling
- Using `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`
- Catching specific exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`
- Example: Safe division input
