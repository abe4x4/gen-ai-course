# Step 3: Core Libraries for Data Science & Machine Learning

In this step, we learn **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn**, which are essential tools for analyzing data and building ML models.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. NumPy
- Arrays, 2D arrays
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Axis operations (mean, sum)

### 2. Pandas
- Series and DataFrames
- Accessing columns and rows
- Filtering data
- Summary statistics

### 3. Matplotlib
- Basic plotting: scatter, line, bar
- Labeling axes and titles

### 4. Scikit-learn
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression
- Predictions and model evaluation

---

## Exercises

1. **NumPy**
   - Create array 1â€“10, compute squares and mean
2. **Pandas**
   - Filter employees by department and age
   - Access specific rows/columns
3. **Linear Regression**
   - Predict Salary based on Age
   - Train-test split and evaluate

## Instructions

1. Run `basics_ds_ml.py` to see examples.
2. Run `exercises.py` and experiment with each exercise.
3. Modify the datasets or models to practice.
4. Commit progress regularly:

### utils.py is optional but recommended. Functions like load_csv() and regression_results() simplify experimentation and evaluation of ML models.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed Step 3: Data Science & ML basics"
