# Step 5: Deep Learning Foundations

In this step, you learn **the basics of neural networks** from scratch and train a simple model on a real dataset.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Neural Network Basics
- Layers: Input, Hidden, Output
- Weights and Biases
- Forward propagation
- Activation functions: Sigmoid, ReLU

### 2. Loss and Backpropagation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Derivative calculation
- Gradient descent

### 3. Training a Model
- Feedforward neural network
- Training on Iris dataset
- Evaluate accuracy on test set

## Instructions

1. Run `train_model.py` to train the neural network on the Iris dataset.
2. Experiment with:
   - Number of hidden neurons
   - Learning rate
   - Number of epochs
3. Modify activation functions in `utils.py` to try ReLU.
4. Commit progress regularly:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Step 5: Deep Learning foundations and simple neural network training"
